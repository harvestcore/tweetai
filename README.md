With this project I want to learn how to create a simple AI using TensorFlow. The main idea is to create an AI that learns how to generate tweets based on the timelines of some Twitter users.

I've never coded an AI before, so this code might have a ton of errors. Please don't judge me.

I'm also planning to develop it as a microservice, so it can be used by one of my other projects (Twitter bot).

Things that I'll be using:
- Python
- TensorFlow
- MongoAtlas
